        "overview": "The United Kingdom (UK) is assessed to be a low-risk destination. The country is a well-developed, politically stable constitutional monarchy with excellent tourist facilities and infrastructure; most visits to the country conclude without incident. The risk of terrorism is rated as medium, and stems from Islamist extremist groups and self-radicalised individuals acting in a personal capacity. In addition, dissident Irish Republican groups pose a terrorist threat to the UK, primarily in Northern Ireland. These risks are mitigated by the fact that UK authorities diligently monitor suspected terrorist activities and individuals, often resulting in periodic security operations and arrests. There is a low risk of crime in the country, however, the risk is significantly higher in the major cities, including the capital, London, than in other areas. The most common crime incidents are petty in nature, involving pickpocketing or opportunistic theft. Busy, crowded areas, such as public transport hubs and tourist sights, face an elevated risk. Violent crime is reported less frequently. Strikes and demonstrations occur regularly in the UK. These often result in disruptions to public services, including transport systems. The UK, particularly London, has seen a rise in protest and strike action in recent years, in response to government reforms aimed at cutting public spending. The majority of these demonstrations are peaceful and well organised; however, there have been incidents of vandalism and low-key violence during high-profile demonstrations. There is an incidental risk to bystanders at such protests; as such, all demonstrations should be avoided as a precaution."
